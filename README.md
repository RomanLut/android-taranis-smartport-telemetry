# Android Taranis SmartPort Telemetry / Roman Lut

This is fork of CrazyDude's excellent application https://github.com/CrazyDude1994/android-taranis-smartport-telemetry

![](doc/screenshot.jpg) 

This version contains support of ROTG01/ROTG02 video receivers with recording:

Latest build is available in Releases: https://github.com/RomanLut/android-taranis-smartport-telemetry/releases

I am contributing most bugsfixes and enchancements to Crazydude's repository. But due to significant differences in UI structure and SDK versions, some features are not merged or merged with delay:
- UVC video support, video recording (DVR)
- sensors: Airspeed, Vertical speed, Altitude MSL, Throttle, Cell Voltage, Telemetry Rate, Distance to home, Travelled distance
- CRSF link quality sensors 
- RC Channels display (8ch for Mavlink v1, 18ch for Mavlink v2, 16 channels for CRSF<sup>1</sup>)
- better support for CRSF and LTM telemetry
- connection status voice messages
- USB VCP cable connection to radios
- topological map
- GPX export
- KML export
- context menu for deleting and renaming logs
- UI interface enchancements
- automatic reconnection (Bluetooth/BLE)
- improved stability and bug fixes

<sup>1</sup> *Channels are displayed with CRSF protocol if they are sent with telemetry. It works with this PR which allows to connect directly to Express LRS TX module:* https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/pull/2731

# Routing telemetry to the application

Multiple possibilities exits.

- route telemetry to the bluetooth module in the radios which have bluetooth installed
- install bluetooth module in the radio yourself
- use Crossfire TX with bluetooth module
- sniff telemetry from S.PORT pin and route to HC-06 / HM-10 module ( see instructions below )
- since version 1.2: route telemetry to USB-C port of the radio ( System->USB-VCP->Telemetry Mirror ) and connect to the phone using OTG cable. Note that USB-C<->USB-C cable may not work; I had to use OTG adapter + cable.
- install ELRS build with BLE telemetry output: https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/pull/2305
- install ELRS build with Bluetooth telemetry output: https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/pull/2101

This android application let you view and record your taranis telemetry data in realtime.

# Hardware and connection
In order this to work you need additional hardware: inverter and bluetooth module (HC-05 or HC-06 or something else, also you don't need module and inverter if your transmitter has internal one)
One important thing: Module should be configured to work on 57600 baud rate, otherwise it won't work. 
Connect inverter to your Smart Port and then connect bluetooth module to the inverter. You now can connect your phone to your bluetooth module and view data

**upd: ** now you can use usb serial connection. More info here https://github.com/CrazyDude1994/android-taranis-smartport-telemetry/issues/47

## Tested modules

Currently we support classic BL,BLE and integrated bluetooth modules into your transmitter. We currently tested them on the HC-05, HC-06, HC-09, HM-10. Make sure that when using BLE module you should disable PIN code (if possible). For classic BL module to appear in the list, you should pair it to your Android device first.

## HC-06 Configuration

By default, HC-06 is configured for 9600bps. To configure, use any USB-to-serial converter and serial client. Mac and Linux can use Terminal `screen` command. Windows users can use [Putty](http://www.putty.org/)

HC-06 module will expect that each command will be entered very fast (AFAIR max 1s between letters). So the best option here is to open text editor, type commands there and then copy them one by one into serial software.

1. `AT+NAMEyournamehere` - no spaces!
1. `AT+PIN1234` - PIN, no spaces again
1. `AT+ENABLEIND0` (you can ommit this command if your module does not support it)
1. `AT+BAUD7` - set port speed to 57600
